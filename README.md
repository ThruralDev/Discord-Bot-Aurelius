# DiscordBot
Bot that was in use for Eyes of Ignolia Discord. He is capable for:
- Waifu Quiz Game.
- Monster Raid Creation to spawn Monsters on a channel and people in community can fight against them in order to earn Erums.
- Role play game for wizards, slaves and assassins. Each Role has it own capabilities to interact with the role game environment.
- Simp Command to print out a card with the name and avatar picture of the person, which was mentioned in that command.
- Market place to spend the earned Erums for Items.
- Give People roles when they buy certain times. That can be used to whitelist them for a spot into a early access nft mint.

I'm sorry that i have no time left to extend its features, making a tutorial about that or anything in that direction, because i'm so busy with other projects.. I have set it to my to-do list to write explicit how to's in order to describe the proper configuration for this bot to work.

This Bot was created with discord.js based on node.js and written in javaScript. There aren't advanced design patterns, but that code worked relatively stable and fine.

All you need to do is to set up a mongoose db with a cluster to save and interact with the data, like tracking players (Of course you can rewrite it with a better or your own solution). Images aren't inside this project (Slimes, Monsters, and Waifu pictures). I handled that stuff with a node reachable through the cloud to load it.

You have to create a config.json File into the project root with configuration keys inside it, which are needed in the related game-files.

I would appreciate pull requests if you desire to improve that code. Only community make software strong and worthfull.

With best regards,
Thrural
